# My-awesome-password-generator

## Description

Hello, this is my submission of a password generator. I created the javascript code for this generator. This was a challenge for me putting my javascript skills that I have learned so far to the test and then some.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

This can be used to generate a random password to the users specifications using a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. The password can have a length between 8 and 128 characters. This can all be achieved with a simple click of the generate password button. Enjoy!
